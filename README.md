# GameSense: Advanced Player Retention Prediction (Ongoing)

## **Overview**

**GameSense: Advanced Player Retention Prediction** is a data science project aimed at predicting player retention in video games using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze player behavior and identify key factors that influence whether a player stays engaged or churns from the game.

## **Current Status**

This project is in its early stages and is currently in the process of gathering and evaluating potential datasets for analysis. As the project progresses, the repository will be updated with data exploration, model development, and insights derived from the analysis.

## **Objectives**

- **Identify and obtain relevant datasets for player retention analysis.**
- **Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.**
- **Explore data to uncover trends and patterns related to player retention.**
- **Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict player retention.**
- **Provide actionable insights to enhance player engagement and reduce churn.**

## **Future Updates**

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves. Contributions and suggestions are welcome as this project is ongoing.
